## Technical Writing and Writting In Tech

If you knew me growing up, there would be no surprise I found a way to meld writing and tech together into a career. I had a deep love for literature instilled in me by both my parents who were English teachers and a wild facination with technology since I was a young boy. 

This personal blog is just a way for me to document my own thoughts and personal projects. If you find something here you think is interesting, feel free to share it with others or just book mark the page for later insperation. My only motive for this blog is to share some of the things I find fascinating and neat. Hopefully you will find something here you also find fascinating and neat, but if you don't that is okay, you should at least enjoy the writing.
