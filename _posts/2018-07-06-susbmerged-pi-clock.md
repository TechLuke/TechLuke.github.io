I stumbled on submerged PCs one day and found them super cool. The idea is to cool overclocked gaming rigs to improve performance. I personally don't do much gaming outside of my Nintendo switch. I do have an Alienware tower and Laptop, but mostly use the extra power for increased performance with video editing and the like, but mostly I just like the look of the things. The idea of submerging electroincs in a liquid though was just too neat to not experiment with, so I started brainstorming ideas.

## Concept

Create an always on computer that would be fully submerged in mineral oil.

# Mineral Oil

Mineral oil is non conductive and disperses heat much faster than air. Electronics can be submerged in the oil without any interference to the components. The oil is clear and looks like water, creating a cool effect.
