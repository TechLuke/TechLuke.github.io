Kratky hydrponics allows for the water efficienty of hydroponics without all the maintenance. This method of hydroponic gardening was invented by [Bernard A Kratky of Hawaii](https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/site/Bio.aspx?ID=KRATKBER). This method of non-circulating hydroponics is super easy and a lot of fun. 

# Kratky - Noncirculating Hydroponics

Plants only need a few things to thrive:

- Water 
- Air
- Sunshine ðŸŒž
- Nutrients (food)
- A place to grow

If you supply a enough of the first four things and give the plant a safe play to grow, it will stretch out and give as much as it takes. Legecy gardening would usually include soil in that list, but technically speaking plants don't *need* soil. If you have limited space and do all your gardening in containers, the soil basically just acts as a support for the plant. If you can grow it in a pot, you can grow it with hydroponics.

Kratky works like most hydroponic systems, except without the need for electricity, pumps, water changes, extra chemicals, wicks, airstones, and all that nonsense. It is a one time setup and forget about method that works great. It even uses less water than container gardening. I've noticed it cuts the water required per plant in about half.

## How Does Kratky Work?

![plant1](/assets/plantAnimation.gif)

The basic setup for Kratky is a bucket or container filled with water with a nutrient solution and a basket to hold the plant and that's it. The roots of the plant rest in the nutrient solution water mix and drink it up like margareitas on the beach. As the plant absorbs the water the level falls, the plant responds by stretching it's roots farther and farther to reach the water. The plant will grow it's roots as fast as the water dissapates, trust me. The parts of the roots that remain above the water level start absorbing the air (remember the list above?) and supply the plant with oxygen. Place the plant in a nice sunny area and that is all that it needs to grow and flourish.

# What You'll Need

The Kratky method only requires a few things to be successful:

- A Bucket
- Net Cup
- Water
- Nutrient Solution
- Gowing Medium
- A plant
- And Some Sunshine

That is all you need, and after the intial set up there is no further maintenance or up keep required.

# The Setup

The initial set up is really the only work invovled, and it is barely even any work at all.

### The Bucket

I like to use the five gallon work buckets that are generally used for painting. You can find these at any hardware store for pretty cheap. I buy black five gallon buckets from the local hydroponics store. I like the black buckets since they completely block out any light, because roots like to grow underground away from the light. You can use any color bucket though, depending on what you can find. The most available buckets are probably the orange buckets sold at [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Home-Depot-5-Gal-Homer-Bucket-05GLHD2/100087613) for under $4.00. They are available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=five+gallon+bucket) as well. I've found though that most household things like cost more on Amazon as sellers just buy them form local stores and sell them for double the price on Amazon. You shouldn't pay more than $6.00 for one of these buckets.

![Add Water To The Bucket](/assets/bucketFill.gif)

Fill the bucket about half way with water.

 If you do more research on this method you might find some videos or articles that start diving into the PH of your local tap water, using bottled spring water, or some other erroneous details that really aren't necessary. The whole point of the Kratky method is to be easy and concise. Sure, you can measure the PH levels and balance it out with some PH solution to maximize your yeild. If you want to do all that then you might as well set up a Deep Water Culture (DWC) system. These system typically have higher yields Than the nin circulating methods, but can get so complicated that they scare off many would be hydroponic gardeners. I say, turn on your hose and just fill up the bucket.


## The Nutrients

 In my example I am using [General Hyroponics](https://generalhydroponics.com/) brand nutrients. There are plenty of other brands you can use and i'd encourage you to expirment with different brands to see what works best for you. 

![Nutrients](/assets/threeNutes.JPG)

The amount of nutrient solution you add depends on the size of the container you are using, so read the directions on the nutrient's bottle. For our five gallon bucket it says to add one teaspoon per gallon of water. So if my math is correct that is five teaspoons of each nutrient solution. 

You can use any size container with the Kratky method. I've expirmented with large 15 gallon totes and smaller three gallon buckets, but i've had the best results with the five gallon buckets.

Once the bucket is half way full, add the first of the three nutrient solutions, FloraMicro. 

![FloraMicro](/assets/floraMicroMeasured.JPG)

The directions on the bottle say you need to add FloraMicro to fresh water and mix it well before adding the other two nutrients. It explains that if you combine the concentrated nutrients together it can cause a nutrient lockout making some of the nutrients unavailable to the plant, so let's do that. Stir the FloraMicro into the water, I just use a bamboo stick.

Next add the FloraGrow to the water and mix well.

![FloraBloom](/assets/floraBloomMeasured.JPG)

Can you guess which one comes next? That's right, the FloraBloom. This isn't your first tutorial is it?

![Net Cup Lid](/assets/waterLevel.JPG)

At this point you can put the net cup lid on the bucket. This will help you determine the water level to use. We want the water to be about two inches above the bottom of the net cup. 

## The Growing Medium

![Clay Pebbles](/assets/netCupWithClay.JPG)

When you grow with hydroponics, the plant's roots are just floating in the water so the plant doesn't have anyway to support itself. There are several different growing mediums used to support plants in hydroponic systems. I use clay pebbles, they work great and have other [benefits](https://university.upstartfarmers.com/blog/pros-cons-hydroton-hydroponics) too.

You can find Hydroton clay pebbles at any hydroponics store. A large 50 liter bag costs around $30, and you can reuse them summer after summer. When I first started exprimenting with Kratky I bought a small bag of clay pebbles off Amazon for $20. This was before I knew how much they should cost.

## The Plants

It is time to add the plants. Kratky works best for leafy greens like lettuce and kale. I have personally had great results with cucumber, basil, and even sun flowers. If you buy seedlings from a nursery you will most likely a soil clump that you need to get rid of before you add the plant to the clay pebbles. 

My trick is to soak the soil clump in water for about 15 minutes and then spray the roots with the hose to break up the soil.

![Root Spray](/assets/rootSpray.gif)

Don't worry, your plant is stronger than you think. This has never hurt any of my plants, root shock generally only happens if you are tearing the roots apart. Remove as much of the soil as possible, you want to keep the water in the bucket as clean as possible (some dirt is inevitable). 

![Kratky](/assets/plantsClay.JPG)

Bury the roots in the clay pebbles, making sure most of the roots are fully submerged in the water. Depending on how many clay pebbles you've used and how long the roots you, you might need to add more water to the bucket. In the image above I planted three cucumbers and one basil plant. I usually do more than one plant per bucket. With butter lettuce i'll do two plants since they get pretty wide, but with vine plants like cuccumber you can do a few more.

# You're Done

Place your Kratky bucket in the appropriate sun for the plant you are growing. You don't need to add water, nutrients, or anything else. The three nutrient solutions we added will carry the plant from seedling to it's vegitative stage and on through it's blooming stage. I would just check on it every few days to make sure everything is going as planned. 

Enjoy
