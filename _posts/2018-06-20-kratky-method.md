Kratky hydrponics allows for the water efficienty of hydroponics without all the maintenance. This method of hydroponic gardening was invented by [Bernard A Kratky of Hawaii](https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/site/Bio.aspx?ID=KRATKBER). This method of non-circulating hydroponics is super easy and a lot of fun.

# What You'll Need

The Kratky method only requires a few things to be successful.

- A Bucket
- Net Cup
- Water
- Nutrient Solution
- Gowing Medium
- A plant
- And Some Sunshine

That is all you need, and after the intial set up there is no further maintenance or up keep required. The only other thing you need to do is harvest the goodies and enjoy.

# The Setup

The initial set up is really the only work invovled, and it is barely even any work. 

## The Bucket

I like to use the five gallon work buckets that are generally used for painting. You can find these at any hardware store for pretty cheap. I buy black five gallon buckets from the local hydroponics store. I like the black buckets since they completely block out any light, because roots like to grow underground away from the light. If you live in a hotter climate with lots of sun, the darker buckets might absorb too much heat and cook the roots though. If that is the case you might be better off with a light colored bucket, like the orange buckets sold at [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Home-Depot-5-Gal-Homer-Bucket-05GLHD2/100087613) for under $4.00.

Fill the bucket about half way with water. You can fill it full now, but to prevent any wasted water let's start with half full and then we'll put the net cup lid on and add the water to our desired level. 

 If you do more research on this method you might find some videos or articles that start diving into the PH of your local tap water, using bottled spring water, or some other erroneous details that really aren't necessary. The whole point of the Kratky method is to be easy and concise. Sure, you can measure the PH levels and balance it out with some PH solution to maximize your yeild. If you want to do all that then you might as well set up a Deep Water Culture (DWC) system. These system typically have higher yields Than the nin circulating methods, but can get so complicated that they scare off many would be hydroponic gardeners. I say, turn on your hose and just fill up the bucket.


## The Nutrients

 In my example I am using [General Hyroponics](https://generalhydroponics.com/) brand nutrients. There are plenty of other brands you can use and i'd encourage you to expirment with different brands to see what works best for you.

The amount of nutrient solution you add depends on the size of the container you are using, so read the directions on the nutrient's bottle. For our five gallon bucket it says to add one teaspoon per gallon of water. So if my math is correct that is five teaspoons of each nutrient solution. 

`You can use any size container with the Kratky method. I've expirmented with large 15 gallon totes and smaller three gallon buckets, but i've had the best results with the five gallon buckets.`

Once the bucket is half way full, add the first of the three nutrient solutions, FloraMicro.

The directions on the bottle say you need to add FloraMicro to fresh water and mix it well before adding the other two nutrients. It explains that if you combine the concentrated nutrients together it can cause a nutrient lockout making some of the nutrients unavailable to the plant, so let's do that. Stir the FloraMicro into the water, I just use a bamboo stick.

Next add the FloraGrow to the water and mix well.

Can you guess which one comes next? That's right, the FloraBloom. This isn't your first tutorial is it?

![Net Cup Lid](/assets/netCup.JPG)

At this point you can put the net cup lid on the bucket. This will help you determine the water level to use. We want the water to be about two inches above the bottom of the net cup.

## The Growing Medium

When you grow with hydroponics, the plant's roots are just floating in the water so the plant doesn't have anyway to support itself. There are several different growing mediums used to support plants in hydroponic systems. I use clay pebbles, they work great and have other [benefits](https://university.upstartfarmers.com/blog/pros-cons-hydroton-hydroponics) too.

You can find Hydroton clay pebbles at any hydroponics store. A large 50 liter bag costs around $30, and you can reuse them summer after summer. When I first started exprimenting with Kratky I bought a small bag of clay pebbles off Amazon for $20. This was before I knew how much they should cost.
