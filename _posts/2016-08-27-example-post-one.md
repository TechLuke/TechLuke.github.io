I stumbled on submerged PCs one day and found them super cool. The idea is to cool overclocked gaming rigs to improve performance. I personally don't do much gaming outside of my Nintendo switch.

The idea of submerging electroincs in a liquid though was just too neat to not experiment with, so I started brainstorming ideas.

A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.
